Important:

Do NOT modify any JavaScript, TypeScript, API calls, state management, or business logic.

Only update:
- HTML structure if needed for layout
- Tailwind / DaisyUI classes
- CSS styling

Do not touch:
- Vue reactive logic
- functions
- stores
- router
- API methods

UI only.


Refine the note card components:

- Add short content preview under title
- Improve spacing between title, meta info, and tags
- Make cards slightly taller and visually balanced
- Add subtle hover elevation
- Ensure responsive layout looks clean

Do not overcrowd with too many elements.


Improve overall visual polish:

- Better typography scale (titles, body, meta text)
- Consistent spacing system
- Softer borders and shadows
- Clear visual hierarchy

Keep the current color theme but make it more refined.
